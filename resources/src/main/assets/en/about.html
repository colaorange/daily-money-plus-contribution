    <p>Dear Users,</p>
    <p>Due to the long lack of maintenance and difficulty in updating the [Daily Money+], and with plans to release an iOS version in the future, I have developed a new version called
        <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.colaorange.dailymoneyone'>[Daily Money One]</a> using a new programming framework. It is now available on Google Play.</p>
    <p>The new version supports <a href="https://youtu.be/IkZsiJ5TAyw">importing Daily Money+ CSV files</a>, and has fixed the <a href="https://youtu.be/hOJdtKElLuw">cloud backup feature</a>.
        Additionally, it offers new features such as split transactions and transfers between account books, and will continue to add new features and fix bugs.</p>
    <p>I should mention that I have included some ads in the app to help cover maintenance costs, but I prioritize ensuring that these ads do not interfere with the user experience.</p>
    <p>Due to limited resources, I will only be maintaining and updating <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.colaorange.dailymoneyone'>[Daily Money One]</a> in the future. You can continue using the current version or try the new version to see if it suits your needs and correctly imports your old data.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions, please message us in the Facebook community at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/colaorange.daily.money">Daily Money</a>. Subscribing and following will allow you to see the latest development progress through video updates.</p>
    <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
    <p>Cola Orange / Dennis</p>
